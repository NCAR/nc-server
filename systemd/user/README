** Capabilities

    nc_server needs the CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE capability to open a socket on a
    port numbered less than 1024. If passed the "-g groups" option, it also
    uses the CAP_SETGID capability.

    If installed from the nc_server RPM, these capabiltiies should be enabled on
    the executable file. To check:

        getcap /opt/nc_server/bin/nc_server
        nc_server = cap_setgid,cap_net_bind_service+p

    If that file has been over-written, or the ownership changed, you will have to
    add the capabilities:

        sudo setcap cap_setgid,cap_net_bind_service+p /opt/nc_server/bin/nc_server

** Systemd

    systemd is an alternative to SysV init scripts.  It is supported on RHEL7 (CentOS 7)
    and Fedora 18.

    Instead of using /etc/init.d/nc_server, one setup systemd to start nc_server
    at boot time from a non-root user's account.

    ** Configure systemd to start a user manager for a non-root user at boot time.
     
        When logged into the user's account, if it has sudo privileges:

            sudo loginctl enable-linger $USER

        or as root:

            user=whomever
            loginctl enable-linger $user

    ** Enable nc_server.service to start on boot from the user's account:

        When logged in as that user (not root):

            # copy nc_server.service file to $HOME/.local/share/systemd/user
            # where systemd can find it.
            usersysd=$HOME/.local/share/systemd/user 
            [ -d $usersysd ] || mkdir -p $usersysd
            cp /opt/nc_server/systemd/user/nc_server.service $usersysd

            systemctl --user daemon-reload

            systemctl --user enable nc_server

    ** To start the service the first time

        systemctl --user start nc_server

    ** To disable and stop nc_server:

        systemctl --user disable nc_server
        systemctl --user stop nc_server

    ** To check status of nc_server:

        systemctl --user status -l nc_server

    ** To check status of all user's "lingering" processes

        systemctl status -l user@$UID
