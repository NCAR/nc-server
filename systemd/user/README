** Setting executable capabilities instead of running as root

    nc_server needs the CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE capability to open a socket on a
    port numbered less than 1024. If passed the "-g groups" option, it also
    uses the CAP_SETGID capability.

    If installed from the nc_server RPM, these capabiltiies will be enabled on
    the executable file. To check:

        getcap /opt/nc_server/bin/nc_server
        nc_server = cap_setgid,cap_net_bind_service+p

    If the executable file has been over-written, or the ownership changed,
    you will have to add the capabilities:

        sudo setcap cap_setgid,cap_net_bind_service+p /opt/nc_server/bin/nc_server

** Systemd

    systemd is an alternative to SysV init scripts.  It is supported
    on RedHat systems, starting with RHEL7 (CentOS 7) and Fedora 18.

    Instead of using an init script on /etc/init.d to start nc_server, it can
    by started by systemd at boot time to run from a non-root user's account.
    at boot time from a non-root user's account.

** Configure systemd to start a manager process for a non-root user at boot time.
 
    When logged into the user's account, if it has sudo privileges:

        sudo loginctl enable-linger $USER

    or as root:

        user=whomever
        loginctl enable-linger $user

    After this is done, all the following commands are done from
    the user's account, not the root account, or with sudo.

** Enable nc_server.service to start on boot from the user's account:

    When logged in as that user (not root):

        # copy nc_server.service file to $HOME/.local/share/systemd/user
        # where systemd can find it.
        mkdir -p $HOME/.local/share/systemd/user 
        cp /opt/nc_server/systemd/user/nc_server.service \
            $HOME/.local/share/systemd/user 

    Customize $HOME/.local/share/systemd/user/nc_server.service
    if you need to.  See man pages:  systemd.unit, systemd.exec
    for more information.

    Load the unit into systemd, and enable it.

        systemctl --user daemon-reload

        systemctl --user enable nc_server

** To start the service the first time:

        systemctl --user start nc_server

** To stop nc_server:

    Note that if another service is running which lists nc_server.service
    in its "Wants" or "Requires" statement, then nc_server will be
    restarted immediately.

        systemctl --user stop nc_server

** To disable and stop nc_server:

        systemctl --user disable nc_server
        systemctl --user stop nc_server

** To check status of nc_server:

        systemctl --user status -l nc_server

** To check status of the user's "lingering" processes:

        systemctl status user@$UID
